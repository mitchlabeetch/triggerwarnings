• Racial Violence, LGBTQ+ Phobia
• Cannibalism

**Medium Severity:**
• Sex/Nudity, Sexual Content
• Eating Disorders, Body Shaming
• Substance Abuse, Drugs, Alcohol
• Medical Procedures, Needles, Surgery

Each profile remembers your preferences, customization, and enabled categories.

⚡ **Real-Time Detection Technology**

• Rapid camera flashes

🌟 **WHY TRIGGER WARNINGS?**
